# Ongoing Concerns and Future Work

This page outlines some of the current limitations of CodeGraphContext and areas for future development.

## Semantic Search

The tool is smart enough to find and analyze a function through millions of code files, but the tool is not yet smart enough to understand that a user searching for “calculate_sum” is also intending to look at the “calculate_addition” function. This level of semantic similarity needs to be researched, developed, tested and eventually implemented by our tool.
