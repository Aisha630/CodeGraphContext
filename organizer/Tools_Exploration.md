# Tools Exploration
There are a total of 14 tools available to the users, and here we have attached illustrative demos for each one of them.

## find_code Tool

The `find_code` tool allows users to search for code snippets, functions, classes, and variables within the codebase using natural language queries. This tool helps developers understand and navigate large codebases efficiently.

Below is an embedded link to a demo video showcasing the usage of the `find_code` tool in action.

## watch_directory Tool

The `watch_directory` tool allows users to monitor a specified directory for file changes, additions, or deletions in real-time. It helps developers automate workflows such as triggering scripts, updating indexes, or syncing files whenever changes occur in the directory.

## analyze_code_relationships Tool

The `analyze_code_relationships` tool in CodeGraphContext is designed to let users query and explore the various relationships between code elements in a codebase, represented as a graph in Neo4j. 

### Relationship Types That Can Be Analyzed

- **CALLS:** Finds which functions call or are called by a function.
- **CALLED_BY:** Finds all functions that directly or indirectly call a target function (inverse of CALLS).
- **INHERITS_FROM:** Finds class inheritance relationships; which classes inherit from which.
- **CONTAINS:** Shows containment (which classes/functions are inside which modules or files).
- **IMPLEMENTS:** Shows which classes implement an interface.
- **IMPORTS:** Identifies which files or modules import a specific module.
- **DEFINED_IN:** Locates where an entity (function/class) is defined.
- **HAS_ARGUMENT:** Shows relationships from functions to their arguments.
- **DECLARES:** Finds variables declared in functions or classes.
